Dwarf rabbit
Dwarf rabbit refers either (formally) to a rabbit with the
dwarfing gene,[1] or (informally) to any small breed of
domestic rabbit or specimen thereof, or (colloquially) to
any small rabbit. Dwarfism is a genetic condition that
may occur in humans and in many animals, including
rabbits. True dwarfism is often associated with a cluster
of physical abnormalities,[2] including pituitary
dwarfism. The process of dwarfing is used to selectively
breed for smaller stature with each generation. Small
stature is a characteristic of neoteny, which may account
(in part) for the attraction of dwarf animals.
The Netherland Dwarf is the smallest of the domestic rabbits.
The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA)[3][4]
accepts a weight range of 1.1–3.5 lb (0.50–1.59 kg), but 2.5 lb
(1.1 kg) is the maximum allowed by the British Rabbit
Council (BRC).[5] The small stature of the Netherland Dwarf
was initially the result of the dwarfing gene: dw. Its short
neck and rounded face are additional features of neoteny.
Many small rabbit breeds have the dwarfing gene, but the
Polish and the Britannia Petite are among those that do not.
They have attained their small stature solely through selective
breeding of successively smaller generations (a process called
dwarfing).
Some small rabbits (often mixed breeds) are a false dwarf, a rabbit that did not inherit the dwarfing gene.
One of the smallest species of wild rabbit is the Marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris), an excellent
swimmer[6] that weighs 2.2–2.6 lb (1.00–1.18 kg).
The following table includes rabbit breeds currently recognized by ARBA[3][4] or by the BRC[5] that have
a maximum weight of 4 lb (1.8 kg). Also included is a small breed from Germany, the Teddy Dwarf.[7]
